# Pocket Fan Controller
  
Manually set the fan speed of "GPD Pocket".  
It can be set in 4 stages.  
For safety reasons, it returns to the default (automatic) at the end of the application.  
  
In the unlikely event the hardware may break down.  
Please use at your own risk.  

You can download from the [release page](https://github.com/t-miyake/PocketFanController/releases).
