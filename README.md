# Pocket Fan Controller
  
Manually set the fan speed of "GPD Pocket (Windows Edition)".  
It can be set in 4 stages.   
Also, it is possible to manually set the CPU temperature at which the fan operates.  
For safety reasons, it returns to the default (automatic) at the end of the application.  
  
In the unlikely event the hardware may break down.  
Please use at your own risk.
